# PDF Whitespace-Inserter

## Currently works with .PNG, and hard inputs and outputs.
- The user currently would convert their PDF to 'input.png', and place that file in a folder named res in the same directory as the app.py.
- User can click and drag to add white space *and that's the entire functionality of this*
- Press 's' key to save, resulting in 'output.png' being desposited in the root directory


  #### This will be a CLI tool, with any luck. You will simply do MakeRoom -input.pdf -output.pdf
